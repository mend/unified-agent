## IMPORTANT
    The Dockerized Unified Agent is no longer supported. We recommend using the stand-alone Unified Agent or one of the [Mend developer integrations.](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/integrations/page/developer_integrations.html)

This repository contains downloads for Mend's Unified Agent releases.

To download a particular release, browse to https://github.com/mend/unified-agent/releases and then select the `jar` binary to download.

The `standAlone` and `dockerized` folders contain examples of how to use the Mend Unified Agent in various scenarios.
